title: Standards Based Assessment

I will use a Standards Based Assessment and Reporting mechanism this semester.
This is a bit of an experiment still, but I hope that it leads to a better way
to provide you with useful feedback about your progress, and to clearer
communication about my expectations of your work.

To get a sense of the main idea, start with this document explaining what the
standards are:

[Euclidean Geometry Standards for Assessment Fall 2014][standards]

## Feedback on your Work

I will be keeping track of what goes on during class to the best of my ability.
After each presentation, the class will have a conversation about your work:
this is your primary source of feedback. Sometimes, I may send an email
from me with some comments about your progress. I think of this mostly as a
formative assessment. It is a way for me to gauge your progress and help you
focus on improving your work.

I will also keep track of referee reports from the process of writing for the
journal. These are the equivalent type of feedback on your written work.

## Reflections & Conferences

To facilitate the communication process, we will schedule regular conferences
to discuss your progress. You will meet with me for a ten minute appointment
every three weeks. That is too much work for me to really get done in any one
week, so I will divide the class into two parts. The first group will meet with
me during weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. The second group will meet with me during
weeks 4, 7, 10, and 13.

To give these meetings some substance, I require that you write a one page
reflection and either bring it to our meeting or email it to me beforehand.
The links below will become live when they become relevant.

- [Reflection Prompt #1][prompt1] (weeks 3 and 4)
- Reflection Prompt #2 (weeks 6 and 7)
- Reflection Prompt #3 (weeks 9 and 10)
- Reflection Prompt #4 (weeks 12 and 13)

Of course, you are welcome to come by and talk about mathematics, or your
progress in the course, at any time I am available.
