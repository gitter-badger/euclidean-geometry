These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### August 25

> **Question A:** (Benson) It appears that the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1
> is true if the rhombus ABCD is a square. Is that the only way it can be true?

#### August 27

> **Question B:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is congruent to BD?

> **Question C:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is less than BD?

#### September 8

> **Conjecture D:** (Herbst) Let AC be a segment and X a point on this segment.
> Suppose that segment BX meets AC at right angles, and segment DX meets AC at
> right angles. Then the points B, X, and D are collinear.

> **Conjecture E:** (Walters) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angles ABC, BCD, CDA,
> DAC, when taken together, make four right angles.


> **Conjecture F:** (Hatchett) Suppose that ABCD is a kite with AB congruent to
> AD and DC congruent to BC. If CD is greater than AD, then angle DAB is greater
> than angle DCB.

### September 15

> **Question G:** (Bieber) How is it possible to construct a point C not lying on
> a given segment AB so that angle ACB is not a right angle?

## September 17

> **Question H:** What should this phrase mean?
> "Points A and B lie on the same side (or on opposite sides) of line segment CD."

> **Challenge I:** Find a workable definition of the term "convex" for quadrilaterals.

> **Challenge J:** Find a workable definition of the phrase "the interior angle
> of a quadrilateral ABCD at the vertex A."

## September 19

> Question K: Will Herbst's argument for the diagonals of a rhombus work in this
> context? If not, where does it fail?

## September 22

> **Question L:** How does Scheidecker's definition for H interact with Nieman's
> construction for 2.2? In particular, what statement is needed (if any) to
> close the gap? Make a conjecture! Or explain why everything is fine.
