These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### August 25

> **Question A:** (Benson) It appears that the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1
> is true if the rhombus ABCD is a square. Is that the only way it can be true?

#### August 27

> **Question B:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is congruent to BD?

> **Question C:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is less than BD?

#### September 8

> **Conjecture D:** (Herbst) Let AC be a segment and X a point on this segment.
> Suppose that segment BX meets AC at right angles, and segment DX meets AC at
> right angles. Then the points B, X, and D are collinear.

> **Conjecture E:** (Walters) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angles ABC, BCD, CDA,
> DAC, when taken together, make four right angles.


> **Conjecture F:** (Hatchett) Suppose that ABCD is a kite with AB congruent to 
> AD and DC congruent to BC. If CD is greater than AD, then angle DAB is greater
> than angle DCB.
