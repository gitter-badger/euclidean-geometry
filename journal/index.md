As part of the work of this course, we will make a mathematical journal with
the students in the course as the authors, referees, and readers. I will play
the role of managing editor.

When you have successfully presented a result and defended it to the class,
you will then write a mathematical paper to share your results in definitive
form. A mathematical paper has a certain format to it, so to help you along,
I have created a template as a writeLaTeX.com document. Professional journals
choose specific styles that authors must adhere to as a way of giving their
printed work a visual distinctiveness.


I have arranged with a service called _WriteLaTeX_ to provide you with a simple
online template for writing papers. You can find a fresh copy by clicking the
link below:

[The WRITELATEX.COM TEMPLATE FOR WRITING PAPERS][template]


_To submit a paper_, send an email to the address **theron.hitchman@uni.edu**
with the subject line in the form **Euclidean Geometry Task ##** where you
replace the ##'s with the proper identifier for the task. From WriteLaTeX there
is an option to download a pdf copy of your paper. Please rename it in the form
**LastName-Task-##.pdf** and attach it to your message.

I advise you to make a (free!) account at writeLaTeX.com so you can make use
of these links and keep your papers together.

This is how we will do it.

## The Process:

Professional Journals all use a version of a simple peer review process. We
will do the same. A description of this is given in this document.

[How a Professional Journal Works][prof-journ]

Of course, you will want more specific guidance when you write your first
paper. Please use these as a starting point.

[Instructions for Authors: Technical Manual][technical-manual]

[A Guide to Using LaTeX][latex]

At some point, you may be asked to referee a paper. This document will then
be helpful.
