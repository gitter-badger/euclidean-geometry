In general, here is how professional mathematics journals work.

1. Author writes a paper in a way to conform with the Journal's declared style.
2. Author submits the paper to the editorial board.
3. Editorial board finds a referee (or perhaps two, or three). Usually, the
author's name is removed.
4. Referee reads paper and checks it.
5. Referee writes a report to the editorial board, and takes a stand on whether
the paper should be published.
6. Editorial board considers opinions of the referee, makes a decision, and
forwards the report to the author.

_If the referee suggests publication:_

Usually, the author has revisions to make to improve the paper. They make these
and resubmit. Now the process starts again, but this time goes faster. When all
are satisfied, the paper is published.

_If the referee does not suggest publication:_

The author revises the paper anyway, and looks for a new journal.

***

We have only one class journal, so getting rejected from the journal will not
happen. Extensive rewriting happens pretty frequently, especially at the
beginning of the semester.

At the beginning of the semester, I shall act as the managing editor and sole
referee. After a few successful papers, you may be asked to referee also.

After submitting a paper, you should expect to get a refereeâ€™s report and have
some editing to do before the paper gets published. When you have more practice,
the amount of reworking a paper requires will likely go down significantly.
