Euclidean Geometry<br />
Math 3600, Fall 2014</h1>
</center>

##Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical, planar geometry, including basic properties
of triangles, circles, quadrilaterals and other polygons, compass and
straightedge constructions, and the notion of area. A focus of the class is
working with axiomatic arguments. Special attention will be given to learning to
construct, read, write, present, and critique mathematical proofs. We will spend
time discussing the nature and role of definitions and the process of
mathematical work. Some of the questions we consider will be asked by
students.

## Materials:

- Text: Euclid’s Elements, Heath translation, Green Lion Press, 2002,  
ISBN 1888009-19-5.
- Software: GeoGebra is a free, open-source geometry program. www.geogebra.org.
- Drawing Tools: You may wish to use a compass and straightedge set. If you do,
I recommend a “modern compass” that may be fixed at a given radius.

## Assessment:

I will be using a “standards based assessment” scheme for this course. See the
relevant handout for more detailed information. Grades in this course are based
on the following assessments, with emphasis on the first item:

- In-class participation, focusing on finding and presenting arguments
- a midterm examination
- a week-long, take-home, final examination

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please contact me.

    Accommodations:
    If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact the instructor early
    in the semester so that your learning needs may be appropriately met. You will need to
    provide documentation of your disability to the Student Disability Services (SDS)
    office, located on the top floor of the Student Health Center, (319) 273-2677.
