*Euclidean Geometry*<br />
*Math 3600, Fall 2014*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical, planar geometry, including basic properties
of triangles, circles, quadrilaterals and other polygons, compass and
straightedge constructions, and the notion of area.

Students who complete this course will learn to work _as a mathematician does_.
To meet this challenge, we will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL] (IBL)
environment.

Successful students will be proficient in working with axiomatic arguments, and
will improve their abilities to construct, read, write, present,
and critique mathematical proofs. Students will gain insight into the nature and
role of definitions and the process of mathematical work. Students will also
learn something about how to ask and answer their own well-formed mathematical
questions.

## Materials:

- Text: [Euclid’s Elements][GreenLionPress], Heath translation,
Green Lion Press, 2002, ISBN 1888009-19-5.
- Software: GeoGebra is a free, open-source geometry program. [www.geogebra.org][ggb].
- Drawing Tools: You may wish to use a compass and straightedge set. If you do,
I recommend a “modern compass” that may be fixed at a given radius.

## Assessment:

I will be using a “standards based assessment” scheme for this course. See the
[relevant handout][sba] for more detailed information. Grades in this course are based
on the following assessments, with emphasis on the first item:

- In-class participation, focusing on finding and presenting arguments
- a midterm examination
- a week-long, take-home, final examination

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please contact me.

**Accommodations:**
  If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact the
  instructor early in the semester so that your learning needs may be
  appropriately met. You will need to provide documentation of your
  disability to the Student Disability Services (SDS) office, located on the
  top floor of the Student Health Center, (319) 273-2677.
