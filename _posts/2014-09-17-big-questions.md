title: Day 10&colon; Big Questions
---

We did a quick journal check-up today. The first issue is out! I have papers
submitted by Hatchett, Scheidecker, Herington, Fisher and Stuffelbeam.
I expect to see papers by Walters et al, Dvorak, Opheim, Hawkins, Hatchett-Westervelt,
Griffen, and Bieber soon.

Many interesting things happened today.

Mr Opheim took up Conjecture 2.4. He attempted to disprove this by constructing a
counter-example. At the end of the presentation, we noted three questions to be
resolved:

  1. How do we know step 6 is possible?
  2. If it is possible, how do we know that circle AD and circle BE even meet?

Answers to these questions would give us a *new construction of a rhombus* different
from the four we saw last time.

  3. How do we know that the resulting figure is **not** a parallelogram?

Answering that would close up Conjecture 2.4 quite tightly.

Miss Benson gave an argument for 3.2:

> **Theorem:** (Benson) Assume that Conjecture 3.1 is true. Then each pair of
> opposite sides of a rectangle is a pair of congruent segments.

Mr Nieman tried to disprove conjecture 2.2 by making an counterexample. His construction
uses the language "on the same side" at a crucial point.

> **Question H:** What should this phrase mean?
> "Points A and B lie on the same side (or on opposite sides) of line segment CD."

Mr Raymond took up conjecture 2.2, and wants to prove it is true in certain cases.
Identifying those cases is not hard visually, but axiomatically we have a challenge.
The ensuing discussion led us to these:

> **Challenge I:** Find a workable definition of the term "convex" for quadrilaterals.

> **Challenge J:** Find a workable definition of the phrase "the interior angle
> of a quadrilateral ABCD at the vertex A."

At the end of class, Miss Teske and Mr Hawkins wished to present on 3.3 and Miss Herbst
was ready to address 3.1. We shall begin there at our next meeting.
