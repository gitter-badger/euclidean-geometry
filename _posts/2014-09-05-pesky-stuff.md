title: Pesky Questions

Our fifth meeting was dedicated to some pesky questions. Namely, can we just
finish items 1.1, A, and 1.2 already?

Miss Herbst outlined a creative approach to Conjecture 1.2. She began by constructing
a point X on the diagonal AC of rhombus ABCD. It is important that this point be chosen
as either (1) the midpoint of AC, or (2) where the angle bisector of angle ABC
meets segment AC. At some point, we need to figure out which defining property
we want to use. Next, the idea is to chase some triangles and prove that the points
B, X, and D are collinear. This looks a bit tricky, but Mr Raymond says it feels
similar to his work on 1.7, where some right angles popped up.

Later, Miss Westerveldt mentioned that she was attempting a proof by contradiction,
which would look completely different. I want you all to know that I would value
having multiple arguments for just about any result. The work of a mathematician
is to produce well-articulated understanding, and there may be many ways to
understand a particular theorem.

We also spent some time discussing the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1 (this
is the one everybody seems to believe is false in general). Mr Walters presented
an argument that a group concocted during discussion. (I believe that this included
Bieber, Dvorak, Nieman and Opheim.) Basically, by relying on all of the work done
before, you can prove that if the second conclusion of 1.1 is true, then the rhombus
is equiangular. There is one final step, which is to conclude that all of the angles
are right angles. I expect that this step will be done for Monday.

I will finish writing up the next set of problems and post them this evening.
I will send an email to the class list-serve when it is done.
