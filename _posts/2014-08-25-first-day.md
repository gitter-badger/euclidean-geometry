title: Our First Meeting
---

We had a successful first meeting today. Our first result is this one:

> **Theorem:** (_Bieber - Hawkins_) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle ABC is
> congruent to angle ADC.

These esteemed gentlemen will get our journal started by submitting a joint
paper explaining their argument.

We had a bit of discussion, and Miss Westervelt started sharing an argument for
why the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1 is false. We ran out of time, so we
will pick up with that at the beginning of our next meeting.

Also, Miss Benson raised an issue which gives us this question:

> **Question A:** (Benson) It appears that the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1
> is true if the rhombus ABCD is a square. Is that the only way it can be true?

I hope we can address this, too. By the way, this is the first item on our
[official list of class conjectures and questions][class].
