We did several things today. And I want to get them all down.

### Journal Check-Up

I think we have this kind of status, as of class time:

#### Papers ready to be published

  * Bieber-Hawkins
  * Fisher

#### Papers in the hands of the authors to be revised

  * Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt
  * Bachmeier
  * <strike>Goodmundson</strike> (and as I type this I get an email ...)

#### Papers Prof Hitchman should referee soon

  * Scheidecker
  * Raymond
  * ...and Goodmundson.

#### Papers yet to be submitted but expected soon

  * Herbst (1.2)
  * Walters (A)
  * Hatchett (2.1)

I really hope to put together an issue of the Journal by the end of the week. A
good size issue has five or six papers in it, so just a little bit of work and
we can get that done.

### Today's proceedings

Miss Stuffelbeam gave a new version of her construction of a family of kites. But
we still need to see a proof that the result is actually a kite. I bet we get this
on Friday.

Miss Dvorak presented on Task 2.2. There was some discussion over her set of
hypotheses, and we ended that discussion by seeing that her proof actually assumed
the conclusion she was after. Not all was lost! We took a look at what the argument
actually achieved, and it turned out to be a proof of 2.5.

> **Theorem:** (Dvorak) Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD and CB congruent
> to CD. If the diagonals AC and BD meet, then they meet at right angles.

Mr Opheim then shared with us his argument for 2.5, since it was put together differently.
Again, we had some discussion about what exactly was assumed. After a good look at
the argument, we found this result:

> **Theorem:** (Opheim) Assume Conjecture D is true.
> Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD and CB congruent to CD. If the diagonals
> AC and BD meet, then they meet at right angles.

We started a discussion on the nature of Definition 10 and Propositions 13-15,
but ran out of time. We will have this conversation next time, so please prepare
for it.

Also, we left the following things unaddressed: Opheim on 2.4, Herington on Conj E,
Fisher on Conj F.

#### Reminder about interviews

Those of you who have made an appointment with me for Thursday, Sept 11, please
remember to bring your reflection paper with you.

#### Open Problems

Current List of Open Problems (with no claims on them whatsoever): 2.2, D.
Still not completely resolved, but with an expected report soon: 2.3, 2.4, E, F.

I will post a new section of the task sequence tonight or tomorrow morning. The
next piece is about _rectangles_!
