First, I am promoting this to a "lettered item:"

Mr Opheim then took up Conjecture 2.4 again. He began by making a construction of
a certain type of kite. This looks promising, but a proof is still needed that
the figure is not a parallelogram.

Then Miss Herbst tried her hand at Conjecture 2.4. She proved this:

> **Theorem:** (Herbst) Let ABCD be a kite which is not a rhombus. Then ABCD is
> not a parallelogram.

Then I challenged you all with this, and we couldn't do it during class. Now it
is an official item on the class list:

> **Question Q:** Why is Miss Herbst's theorem insufficient to disprove 2.4?
> What do we need to fill in the gap?

Finally, the long suffering Mr Bieber finally got his chance to present on 3.6.

> **Theorem:** (Bieber) Let ABC be a triangle. Let D be the midpoint of AB and E
> the midpoint of AC. Then DE is parallel to BC.
