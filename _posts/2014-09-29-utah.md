title: Utah!

We began with Mr Opheim taking a new approach to Conjecture 2.4. This didn't quite
come to a conclusion, and he decided to pass the chalk.

Miss Westervelt then proposed an alternate discussion of the word "convex," at
least for quadrilaterals.

This was reasonably well-received.

Mr Nieman took a different approach, and his proposal led to a long conversation
which generated more questions than answers. In other words, this was awesome and
fun for me.

We considered the hourglass figure. It seems that by Mr Nieman's definition, the
hourglass is convex, but by Miss Westervelt's definition it is not convex. Curiouser
and curiouser...

Oh, and we considered a non-simple octagonal figure drawn by Mr Scheidecker, that we
decided to call "Utah." I am very fond of this name. And as an example it is very
useful.

Here were the new questions:

> **Question M:** What is an "interior angle"? an "exterior angle?"

> **Question N:** What is the "inside" of a polygon?

> **Question O:** Is the hourglass a quadrilateral? or a hexagon? or two triangles? WTH?

By my count, we have had 15 class meetings. Question O is our 15th class generated item
for investigation. That is one question or conjecture per class! I am so excited.
