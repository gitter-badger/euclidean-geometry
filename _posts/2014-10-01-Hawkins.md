title: Mr Hawkins and his two curious theorems
---

So, Mr Hawkins proved two theorems today. Each seemed quite clever. Taken together,
they are worrying.

> **Theorem:** (Hawkins) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral such that angles ABC
> and ADC are right angles. If segments AB and CD are congruent,
> then ABCD is a rectangle.

> **Theorem:** (Hawkins) It is possible to construct with straightedge and compass
> a quadrilateral ABCD so that ABC and ADC are right angles, AB and CD are congruent,
> and the quadrilateral ABCD is not simple.

So, I guess we better stare deeply into the souls of these until we figure out what
happened.
