title: 27 August--Discussion on Conjecture 1.1
---

We began with Miss Westervelt presenting ideas that were unfinished at the end
of last meeting.

Miss Herbst picked things up, and we had a long discussion. As I recall, Miss
Benson and Mr Nieman contributed some, and the end result is this.

> **Theorem:** (Benson-Nieman-Herbst-Westervelt) Let ABCD be a rhombus. If segment
> AC is greater than segment BD, then angle BAC is less than angle BDC.

As we discussed, this is wonderful, but leaves us with an unsatisfied feeling that
maybe there is more we could understand better. So the next two items get added
to our [list of class questions and conjectures][class]

> **Question B:** What happens when AC is congruent to BD?
>
> **Question C:** What happens when AC is less than BD?

Of course, we still haven't yet decided this: Does this work settle the second
half of Conjecture 1.1?
