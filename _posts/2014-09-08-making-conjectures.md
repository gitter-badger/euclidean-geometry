title: Sept 8, Making Conjectures
---

We had deeper discussion on several things today, and we ended up employing the
tactic of "picking a careful statement." This involves adding a hypothesis or
weakening a conclusion to fit what we can actually prove, and then stating what
is left as a question or a conjecture.

Remember: half a proof is no proof, but progress is progress. It is important to
frame your results. Say what you **can** do and take credit for it.

With this in mind, here is the run-down of new items.

> **Conjecture D:** (Herbst) Let AC be a segment and X a point on this segment.
> Suppose that segment BX meets AC at right angles, and segment DX meets AC at
> right angles. Then the points B, X, and D are collinear.

> **Theorem:** (Herbst) if Conjecture D is true, then Conjecture 1.2 is a theorem.

> **Conjecture E:** (Walters) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angles ABC, BCD, CDA,
> DAC, when taken together, make four right angles.

> **Theorem:** (Walters) If Conjecture D is true, then Question A has an affirmative
> answer.

Miss Hatchett took up Conjecture 2.1.

> **Theorem:** (Hatchett) If ABCD is a kite with AB congruent to AD and DC congruent
> to BC, then angle ADC is congruent to angle ABC.

> **Conjecture F:** (Hatchett) Suppose that ABCD is a kite with AB congruent to
> AD and DC congruent to BC. If CD is greater than AD, then angle DAB is greater
> than angle DCB.

Miss Stuffelbeam started work on 2.3, but we ran out of time. Mr Opheim had promised to do
2.4 and 2.5. Since we still have five or more open questions, I won't give you any more
to do. But I am preparing some exciting questions about _rectangles_!
