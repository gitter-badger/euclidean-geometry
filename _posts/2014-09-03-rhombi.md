title: Rhombi!
---

Our fourth meeting was very productive, with four tasks completed, and five
theorems. Here is a quick run down:

Mr Fisher addressed question B.

> **Theorem:**(Fisher) Let ABCD be a rhombus. If AC is congruent to BD, then
> angle BAC is congruent to angle BDC.

Mr Scheidecker took up question 1.5. He noted that Miss Bachmeier's construction
is only capable of constructing rhombi which are made by stacking a pair of
equilateral triangles, and then gave an alternate construction.

> **Theorem:**(Scheidecker) Let segment AB be given. It is possible to construct
> with a straightedge and compass a large family of rhombi having AB as a side.

Miss Goodmundson tackled item 1.6.

> **Theorem:**(Goodmundson) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. If ABCD is a rhombus,
> then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Finally, Mr Raymond took up item 1.7, and we got two theorems out of his work,
because I think that one of his intermediate steps is independently interesting.

> **Theorem:**(Raymond) Suppose that the diagonals of a rhombus ABCD meet at a
> point X. Then the four triangles ABX, ADX, CBX, and CDX are mutually congruent.

> **Theorem:**(Raymond) Suppose that the diagonals of a rhombus ABCD meet at a
> point X. Then the diagonals are perpendicular.

Note that these theorems are _conditional_, because they include the hypothesis
that the diagonals meet. If we can settle Conjecture 1.2, perhaps we can remove
that hypothesis.
