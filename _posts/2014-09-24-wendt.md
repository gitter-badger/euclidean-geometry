title: Mr Wendt's Russian Seminar Experience
---

Wow. What a way to break onto the scene. Today Mr Wendt gave his first presentation
by tackling a difficult theorem in a creative and interesting way.

We had a long discussion. At the end, it looks like the only gap in the argument
is that nasty one about making a construction that needs three points collinear,
but not knowing that this is the case, yet.

I trust Mr Wendt will follow up on this, and we will soon see he has a way around it.
