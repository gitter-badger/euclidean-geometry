So far this term, every argument has used a pair of congruent triangles somewhere.
UNITL TODAY! Did you appreciate the new argument when it happened? This is a spot
where our mathematical toolbox grew.

Miss Herbst took up 3.1, and she handled it directly.

> **Theorem:** (Herbst) Let ABCD be a rectangle. Then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Mr Hawkins took up 3.3. When pressed, it seems that the argument needs an extra
hypothesis.

> **Theorem:** (Hawkins) Let ABCD be a rectangle. Then the diagonals AC and BD
> are congruent.
> Furthermore, if AC and BD meet at some point X, then X is the midpoint of both.

This leaves us with a question. When do these diagonals meet? We suspect that the
answer is "always." This kind of question has come up before.

> Question K: Will Herbst's argument for the diagonals of a rhombus work in this
> context? If not, where does it fail?

Miss Teske addressed 3.5. We had a longer look at this argument. It relies on
Euclid Proposition I.33, which is a bit hard to read. In the end, it looks like
it works fine, but there is still a small hole in the argument. I expect that Miss
Teske will finish her argument shortly.

Then Miss Goodmundson gave a different argument for 3.5.

> **Theorem:** (Goodmundson) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral such that angles ABC and
> ADC are right angles. If segments AB and CD are parallel then ABCD is a rectangle.

Quick check on the open problems list: We still haven't seen a completion of 2.2
or 2.5. Items 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7 haven't been touched at all.
And the class conjectures G through K are open.
