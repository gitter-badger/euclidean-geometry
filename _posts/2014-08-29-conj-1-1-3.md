title: Closing in on Conjecture 1.1
---

That was a good productive day. Keep up the hard work and we will start proving
theorems in bunches.

I got class photos and a seating chart. This should help me learn names. SHOULD.

Miss Herbst took up Question C, and we had conversation about handling cases
that look a lot like theorems and proofs we have already given. In the end,
we settled Question C by saying it was very similar _etc_ _etc_, and decided
that for a proof, we could write something about how this argument is the same
as the one we constructed in our last meeting, but you have to rearrange the
symbols on the page in a certain way.

> **Theorem:** (Herbst) Let ABCD be a rhombus. If AC is less than BD, then angle
> BAC is greater than angle BDC.

Then Mr Fisher took up question B. The argument got hung up on an attempt to use
Euclid I.4. There was a lot of mumbling in class about how this line of argument
was salvageable, so I expect that Mr Fisher will complete the argument at our next
meeting.

Miss Bachmeier took up Challenge 1.4 and gave a construction of a rhombus.

> **Theorem:** (Bachmeier) Let AB be a given segment. Then it is possible to
> construct, with compass and straightedge, a rhombus having AB as one of its sides.

Note that question 1.5 is now a really neat thing to look at. :)

Good work. Have a good long weekend.
