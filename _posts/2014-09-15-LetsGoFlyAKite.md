title: Let's Go Fly a Kite
---

Today we had several constructions of kites. I really like the first two lines
of dialogue here:

Essentially, today we got *four* proofs of this:

> **Theorem:** (Stuffelbeam, Hatchett-Westervelt, Griffin, Bieber)
> It is possible to construct a kite with a compass and straightedge.

The four proofs each show off some aspect of what is going on, and they lead to
more or less general constructions. I was happy to see them all.

Miss Stuffelbeam's approach constructs the diagonals of the kite first, and leads
to rather boxy, roundish kites.

The Hatchett-Westervelt construction also uses the diagonals to get rolling, but
each set-up actually produces three different kites.

Mr Griffin's approach is very similar to Miss Stuffelbeam's, but has a bit of shift
in perspective that allows us to get kites which are not so round.

Mr Bieber's approach is an attempt to use circles as little as possible. He notes
that in his construction you can design the round/not round part by an appropriate
choice.

Along the way, we identified the following thing which we keep using over and over.

> **Theorem:** (Folk Theorem $\alpha$) Let ABC be a triangle with AB congruent to AC.
> If X is the midpoint of AC, then segment BX is perpendicular to segment AC.

Also, Mr Bieber's construction leaves us with this very interesting question, which
is now added to our list of class conjectures.

> **Question G:** (Bieber) How is it possible to construct a point C not lying on
> a given segment AB so that angle ACB is not a right angle?

We had a very good day, but we still have a pile up of willing presenters.
