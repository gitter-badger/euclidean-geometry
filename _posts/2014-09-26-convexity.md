title: Day 14&colon; Convexity?
---

We had a long conversation about Mr Scheidecker's approach to convexity today.
I feel as though we made lots of progress, but we aren't quite done with the this,
yet.

I neglected to make available the paper by Mr Ball. [You can find it here.][ball]

Please consider coming the The Math Department ShinDig on Thursday next week.
We have a fun picnic with food provided, and I need people to help me beat Dr Stanley
at kickball. That's right, we play kickball, and Stanley and I are usually captains.
Signs with details are up all over the department.

Anyway, I look forward to seeing more work on 2.2, 2.4, 3.4, and 3.6, and the stuff
in task sequence part 4. Have a good weekend.
