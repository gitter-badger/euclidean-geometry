[GeoGebra][ggb] is a free, open-source, interactive and dynamic mathematics
package which has good support for playing with Euclidean geometry concepts.

You can use the software in many ways:

- download your own copy from the web site
- use a Google Chrome Web App
- use the Java-based “web start” version
- one of the Android or iOS apps

Often, I use the chrome web app, which will connect with a UNI Google Drive to save
your work. I encourage you to play around with the software. It is very useful.
