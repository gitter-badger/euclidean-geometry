[GeoGebra][ggb] is a free\*, open-source, interactive and dynamic mathematics
package which has good support for playing with Euclidean geometry concepts.

You can use the software in many ways:

- download your own copy from the web site
- use a Google Chrome Web App
- use the Java-based “web start” version
- one of the Android or iOS apps

Often, I use the chrome web app, which will connect with a UNI Google Drive to save
your work. I encourage you to play around with the software. It is very useful.

\* <small>There is a bit of funny business here. GeoGebra is not totally free to everyone.
But it will be free for you as long as you do not try to use it to build another
product to sell.</small>

 There are two games worth your attention, too.

 [Dragonbox Elements][dragonbox] is not free, but it is not too expensive.
 It is marketed as a way to learn the process of making axiomatic arguments
 in the context of classical geometry. I played it and had fun, and I can see
 the potential.

 [Euclid the Game][euclid] is a free online game based on GeoGebra. It has
 a large number of construction challenges which are typical objects of study
 in classical geometry built in. You can learn something by completing these,
 too.
